# A tool for a bookkeeper
This REST API application helps managing books and storing them in a mysql database.

## How to use it?
* First of all, in order to even get this to build and work you need to install [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) and [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)  
* Remember your root password when setting up MySQL
* Set MySQL up for a localhost with a port 3306
* Create a new schema called 'books'
* Clone this repository and change some variables in /rest/src/main/resources/application.properties
* * Set the username to your MySQL username (By default it is ```root```) ```spring.datasource.username=root```
* * Set the password to your MySQL password ```spring.datasource.password=PASSWORD```

* Now it should be compiled and see a new table called "book" in your MySQL database after refresh!

* Using Postman you have to create a GET request to localhost:8080 (default) using this request URL ```localhost:8080/books``` to return all of the books and it should return this ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56818310/216030463-cab3b7c5-c200-4861-b6ee-9abd1167e825.png)
 
## Insert a new book
* To add a book create a POST request with a request URL of ```localhost:8080/save``` and with a body of (raw and JSON)  
```json
{
    "title": "Art3",
    "author": "Boro",
    "release_year": 2023
}
```

## Update a book
* To update a book, we need to know the book ID. We get the ID from requesting the full list of the books and looking at the "id" row.
* If the desired book ID is 1, we create a new PUT request with a request URL of ```localhost:8080/books/update/1``` 1 being the ID. We also need to create a JSON body for the updated information.
```json
{
    "title": "Art4",
    "author": "Boro2",
    "release_year": 2024,
    "availability": false
}
```

* These tests has to be ran in the order the @Test functions are created.
